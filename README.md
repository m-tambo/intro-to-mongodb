# MongoDB
In this repo, I get to learn one of the most popular noSQL database engines by making queries to a mock dataset.

Unlike a "flat" relational database, Mongo relies on nested objects with key/value pairs. The table restrictions are gone, but so are some of the other useful data relationships.
